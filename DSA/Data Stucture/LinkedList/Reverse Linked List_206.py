# 206. Reverse Linked List

# Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]
# Example 3:

# Input: head = []
# Output: []
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
# -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None  # Initialize prev as None
        curr = head  # Start with curr at the head of the list

        while curr:
            temp = curr.next  # Store the next node
            curr.next = prev  # Reverse the pointer
            prev = curr       # Move prev forward
            curr = temp      # Move curr forward

        return prev  # prev is the new head of the reversed list
