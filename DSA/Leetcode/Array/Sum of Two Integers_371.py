# 371. Sum of Two Integers

# Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

# Example 1:

# Input: a = 1, b = 2
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: a = 2, b = 3
# Output: 5
 
# Constraints:

# -1000 <= a, b <= 1000

class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        # if number is positive
        while a > 0:
            a -= 1
            b += 1

        while b > 0:
            a += 1
            b -= 1

        # if number is Negative
        while a < 0:
            a += 1
            b -= 1

        while b < 0:
            a -= 1
            b += 1


# Intuition

# To solve the problem of summing two integers without using the + or - operators, we can utilize bitwise operations. The key is to understand how binary addition works:

# The XOR (^) operation gives the sum without carrying over.
# The AND (&) operation identifies where the carry occurs.
# Shifting the carry by one bit (<<) simulates carrying over to the next significant bit.
# We repeat this process until there are no more carry operations left.


# Approach

# Use a 32-bit mask (0xFFFFFFFF) to handle negative numbers and simulate a 32-bit integer.
# Perform the addition using XOR for the sum and AND for the carry.
# Shift the carry by one position to the left.
# Update the operands with the new sum and carry.
# Repeat until the carry becomes zero.
# Adjust for negative numbers if the result exceeds the maximum 32-bit integer.
# Example Walkthrough
# Input: a=3, b=5

# Binary representation:

# a = 0011
# b = 0101

# Step 1:

# XOR (^): 0011 ^ 0101 = 0110 (sum without carry)
# AND (&): 0011 & 0101 = 0001 (carry)
# Shift carry: 0001 << 1 = 0010

# Step 2:

# Update a = 0110 and b = 0010.
# XOR: 0110 ^ 0010 = 0100
# AND: 0110 & 0010 = 0010
# Shift carry: 0010 << 1 = 0100

# Step 3:

# Update a = 0100 and b = 0100.
# XOR: 0100 ^ 0100 = 0000
# AND: 0100 & 0100 = 0100
# Shift carry: 0100 << 1 = 1000

# Step 4:

# Update a = 0000 and b = 1000.
# XOR: 0000 ^ 1000 = 1000
# AND: 0000 & 1000 = 0000 (no carry left).
# Result: a = 1000 (decimal 8).

# Python-Specific Explanation

# Python handles integers differently compared to other programming languages. Python integers are not limited to 32-bits and can grow arbitrarily large. However, in this problem, we need to simulate 32-bit integer behavior, where integers are bounded to 32 bits and can represent both positive and negative values. This requires additional handling in Python using a mask and the concept of two's complement for signed integers.

# What is a Mask?
# A mask is a bit pattern used to isolate or manipulate specific bits of a number. In this solution, we use the mask 0xFFFFFFFF, which represents a 32-bit binary number of all 1's (11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary).

# This mask helps us:

# Ensure all calculations stay within 32 bits.
# Handle signed numbers by simulating the boundaries of 32-bit integers.

# Why AND the Results with the Mask?
# When performing bitwise operations in Python, numbers can exceed 32 bits. To restrict results to 32 bits, we use the bitwise AND operator (&) with the mask. You can imagine that since the mask is only 32 bits, AND'ing a number with a mask forces us to only use 32 bits.

# mask = 0xFFFFFFFF # 1111 .... 1111, 32 ones
# number & mask # we effectively trim the number to only use 32 bits

# Why Flip the Bits and Take Two's Complement?
# In Python, numbers are treated as unsigned by default, meaning Python will interpret all binary representations as positive integers. To simulate signed 32-bit integers (e.g., negative numbers), we need to handle cases where the result of our operation exceeds the maximum positive value of a 32-bit integer (2^31 - 1).

# Here’s the process:

# If the result of the computation exceeds the 32-bit signed integer max (2^31 - 1), we know it’s a negative number in the context of 32-bit integers.
# To convert this value into its correct signed representation, we invert its bits using a bitwise XOR with the mask 0xFFFFFFFF:
# # this example assumes an int is 4 bits instead of 32 for easier reading
# mask = 1111
# a =    1100 # python treats this as 12 in unsigned format
# flipped_bits = a ^ mask = 0011
# Next, we re-flip back the bits using python's two complement operator to force python to treat the number as a signed, negative value
# # ~ is the 2s complement operator in python. ~x = -x-1 
# flipped_bits = a ^ mask = 0011
# ~flipped_bits = ~(a ^ mask) = 1100 # python now treats this as -4
# Therefore, if our final sum is less than 2^31 - 1, we return back the answer, else we return back ~(a ^ mask)

# Complexity
# Time complexity: O(32)
# Space complexity: O(1)


class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        mask = 0xFFFFFFFF  # 32 bit mask
        maxInt = 2**31 - 1

        while b != 0:
            sum = (a ^ b) & mask # contain to 32 bits
            carry = (a & b) & mask # contain to 32 bits
            a = sum
            b = carry << 1
        
        return a if a <= maxInt else ~(a ^ mask)
